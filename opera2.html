   <h5> DIA and MER</h5> <p>[looking off] </p>Why, who's this? Jupiter, by Jove.
  
   <p> [Enter Jupiter, an extremely old man, very decrepit, with very
    thin straggling white beard, he wears a long braided dressing
    gown, handsomely trimmed, and a silk night-cap on his head.
    Mercury falls back respectfully as he enters.]</p>
  
    <h5>JUP.</h5> Good day, Diana.  Ah, Apollo.  Well, well, well, what's the
    matter? What's the matter?
  
    <h5>DIA.</h5> Why that young scamp Mercury says that we do nothing, and
    leave all the duties of Olympus to him. Will you believe it, he
    actually says that our influence on earth is dropping down to
    nil.
  
    <h5>JUP.</h5> Well, well. Don't be hard on the lad.  To tell you the
    truth, I'm not sure that he's far wrong. Don't let it go any
    further, but, between ourselves, the sacrifices and votive
    offerings have fallen off terribly of late. Why, I can remember
    the time when people offered us human sacrifices, no mistake
    about it, human sacrifices.  Think of that.
  
    <h5>DIA.</h5> Ah. Those good old days.
  
    <h5>JUP.</h5> Then it fell off to oxen, pigs, and sheep.
  
    <h5>AP.</h5> Well, there are worse things than oxen, pigs and sheep.
  
    <h5>JUP.</h5> So I've found to my cost. My dear sir, between ourselves,
    it's dropped off from one thing to another until it has
    positively dwindled down to preserved Australian beef. What do
    you think of that?
  
    <h5>AP.</h5> I don't like it at all.
  
    <h5>JUP.</h5> You won't mention it. It might go further.
  
    <h5>DIA.</h5> It couldn't fare worse.
  
    <h5>JUP.</h5> In short, matters have come to such a crisis that there's no
    mistake about it—something must be done to restore our
    influence, the only question is, what?
  
    <h5>MER.</h5> [Coming forward in great alarm. Enter Mars]
         Oh incident unprecedented.
         I hardly can believe it's true.
  
    <h5>MARS.</h5> Why, bless the boy, he's quite demented.
         Why, what's the matter, sir, with you?
  
    <h5>AP.</h5> Speak quickly, or you'll get a warming.
  
    <h5>MER.</h5>  Why, mortals up the mount are swarming
         Our temple on Olympus storming,
         In hundreds—aye in thousands, too.
