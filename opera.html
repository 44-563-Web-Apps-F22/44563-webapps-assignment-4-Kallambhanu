        <h4>THESPIS ACTI</h4>
        <h5>[Scene—The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
            Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with
            ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
            columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of
            stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
            should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to
            ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
            mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which
            clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
            duty as fatigued with their night's work]</h5>
         <pre><p style="color:red"></p>CHO.  Through the night, the constellations,
                Have given light from various stations.
                When midnight gloom falls on all nations,
                We will resume our occupations.</p><br>
                <p style="color:green"> SOLO. Our light, it's true, is not worth mention;
            What can we do to gain attention.
            When night and noon with vulgar glaring
            A great big moon is always flaring.
            [During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
                wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.  A hood is over her head, a
                respirator in her mouth, and galoshes on her feet. During the
                chorus, she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
                in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana, the goddess of the moon.
                DIA. [shuddering] Ugh. How cold the nights are.  I don't know how
                    it is, but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
                    used to. But it is time for the sun to be rising. [Calls] Apollo.</p>

                    <p style="color:green">DIA.<br>I've come off duty—it's time for you to be getting up.<br>
                 [Enter Apollo. He is an elderly "buck" with an air of assumed
                    juvenility and is dressed in dressing gown and smoking cap.<br></p>
                    <p style="color:green">AP.<br>[yawning] I shan't go out today. I was out yesterday and the
                        day before and I want a little rest. I don't know how it is,but I
                        seem to feel my work a great deal more than I used to.<br></p>
                        <p style="color:green">DIA.<br>I am sure these short days can't hurt you.  Why you don't
                            rise til six and you're in bed again by five; you should have a
                            turn at my work and see how you like that—out all night.<br></p>       
                            <p style="color:green">MER.<br>Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.<br></p>
                            <p style="color:green">DIA.<br> You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
                            third time you've been out this week.<br></p>
                            <p style="color:green">MER.<br> Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.<br></p>
                            <p style="color:green">DIA.<br> I can't help being out all night.<br></p>
                            <p style="color:green">MER.<br> And I can't help being down all night. The nature of Mercury
                            requires that he should go down when the sun sets, and rise again
                            when the sun rises.<br></p>
                            <p style="color:green">DIA.<br> And what have you been doing?<br></p>
